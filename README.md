# Lemma-App
Lemma-App was developed by WG-tech team, this project was the winner of the GDG Digital Wellbeing Hackathon 2018.

Lemma is a mobile social networking platform adapted for family use which offers the following features :
- Organize "lemma" by inviting family members.
- Activate the "lemma mode" which allows to block the notifications on the devices of their children so have more time for your family and especially pay attention during family gatherings.
- Allow parents to control the accounts of their children and activate the "lemma mode" during meetings and outings ...
- Stay in touch with the family and share your best moments in your family space.
- Never miss an event related to your family (a party, a birthday ...)

This project is developed with the cross platform xamarin forms with the use of the firebase service and the sqlLite database for the lemma mode. We intend to implement it with AppOsManager.
